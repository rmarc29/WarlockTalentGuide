# WarlockTalentGuide DEPRECATED !!! Use [Unified-Talent-Guides](https://github.com/rmarc29/Unified-Talent-Guides)
## Info
This is an AddOn for World of Warcraft Vanilla (v.1.12), that will show warlock players what talent to choose.
Based on wowhead's hardcore warlock demonology spec guide : https://www.wowhead.com/classic/guide/classes/warlock/hardcore-leveling-tips

## Future
I'll try to create all the other classes guides soon enough, I'll link everything down here :
- [Hunter Guide](https://github.com/rmarc29/HunterTalentGuide)
- [Druid Guide](https://github.com/rmarc29/DruidTalentGuide)
- [Warrior Guide](https://github.com/rmarc29/WarriorTalentGuide)

At the end my project is to try to create a single AddOn that will track which class you play so you won't have to constantly switch between them.

-- Feel free to fork and modify stuff around
